Assessed learning outcomes: A Systematically comprehend the theoretical foundations ofNatural Language Processing B Apply statistical    and       machine    learning techniques to process       and       analyze    natural language data 
Overview Sentiment   Analysis   is   the   process   of determining   whether   textual   content   expresses   a   positive,   neutral,   or   negative   sentiment.   With   the   vast   amount   of textual   data   (e.g.,   tweets,   Reddit   posts,   reviews)   generated   daily,   Sentiment   Analysis   can   automatically   identify   users'   attitudes   from   User-Generated    Content    (UGC),      assisting      companies      or      organizations      in      making      informed   decisions.
1. Literature Review on Sentiment Analysis (20 Marks,    Individual Work) 
a)          Overview   of the   sentiment   analysis   and   its   applications.   Please   provide   three   examples   of   real-life   applications   of   sentiment   analysis. (6 Marks)
b)       Please list three   key   challenges   in   sentiment   analysis.   (6 Marks)
c)          Please   elaborate   on   two   traditional   methods   (e.g.,   Naive   Bayes,   SVM)   and   two   deep   learning   approaches   (e.g.,   BERT,   GPT)   on   the   sentiment   analysis.   Meanwhile,   discuss   the advantages and disadvantages of   each approach.      (8 Marks)
d) Each       team       member          should       individually       complete the       literature       review       on sentiment analysis. This section will be scored individually. 
2. Data Collection (12 Marks, Group Work ) Collect   two   datasets   of User-Generate代 写DTS406TC Natur al Language Processing Coursework 1Python
代做程序编程语言d   Content   (UGC)   from   platforms   like   Twitter,   Reddit,   or   Weibo,    focusing   on    sentiment    analysis    in    different    scenarios.    Each    dataset    should    contain    a   minimum   of   3,000 instances. Preprocess   the   datasets   by   performing   tasks   like   stopword   removal and tokenization.   Finally,   a   statistical   analysis   of   the two   datasets   should be   conducted   (e.g.,   the   word   distribution   of   the   corpus). Notice   that   some   UGC   data   may   be   downloaded   from   Kaggle   if there   are   API   restrictions   preventing   direct   downloads   from   social   platforms.   (6 Marks/dataset x 2=12 Marks)
3. Algorithm Description  Implementation    (48 Marks, Group Work) 
a)          Choose   four   approaches   for   the   sentiment   analysis   task   on   the   collected   UGC   datasets:   two   using   traditional   methods   and   two   employing   deep   learning   methods.       All    four   approaches   should   be   applied   to   each   of   the   UGC   datasets.   Please   provide   the   pseudo-   code and briefly provide      the      comments for each function of the pseudo-code.      (5 Marks/algorithm x 4= 20 Marks)
b)         Develop a sentiment analysis   system for each approach   using Python. The   implementation   pipeline   should   include   the   following   components:   feature   engineering   (3    Marks,    e.g.,    converting    textual      data      to embedding space regarding to different   approaches), algorithm implementation (3 Marks, with fine-tuning required for   the   deep   learning   approach),   and   metrics   computation   (1 mark). 7 Marks/algorithm x 4 = 28 Marks)
4. Results Analysis (13 Marks, Group Work) 
a)          Provide the sentiment analysis results for each approach applied to the two UGC   datasets.   Select   and   apply three relevant metrics   (e.g., precision, recall,   and   F   1   score)   to   assess   the   performance   of   the   implemented   models, with   each   metric   worth 3 Marks.   (9 Marks)
b)         Explain the   reasons behind the model   performance for each approach.          (1 Mark/algorithm x 4 = 4 Marks)
5. Report Writing (7 Marks, Group Work) This   coursework   evaluates   your   understanding   the   challenges   of   the   problem   and   the   correctness of    the proposed algorithms. It also tests your professional skills in terminology      usage,   presentation      of algorithms and experimental results, as well as the logical manner of the   proposal. (7 Marks)
Submission One   of the team members must   submit a single zip   file. The zip file is named   "TeamID_Coursework.zip".   It   includes:      a   cover   letter   with   the   group   member   information   and   the   final   PDF   reports.   The   final   PDF   reports   includes   the   individual   reports   of literature   review   on   the   sentiment   analysis   and   the   group   report.   A   folder   labeled   "algorithms"   contains   all   the   model    implementations,    data    preprocessing    scripts,    and    evaluation      scripts.    A      folder      labeled "data" contains all the datasets and the experimental results   in the   CSV   format.
